# Development notes

spellright:

    [x] Settings change does not null diagnostics for invisible windows e.g. when languages are added
    [x] Eng. Does not spell with dot! (<- multi language spelling backfire)
    [x] No reaction to commands when adding second language e.g.:  on adding "en" does not refresh in: spellcheck-language "fr" "en" - same language as default added - no refresh, but there should be!

    [x] GUI with checkmarks
    [x] Suggestions in popup menu should be provided for all languages spelled
    [x] Cache multiple languages on spelling API level
    [x] Iterate over language sets on all levels: spellright.language, spellright.languageContext, spellright.languageContextByClass

    [ ] Shift+Click should 'replace all' (currently not possible to capture Ctrl state)

    [ ] Ctrl+. menu screenshot (people ask "How to correct?")

    [x] Multipane screenshots (easier to maintain)
    [-] Absolute paths to ignore (ignoreFiles and .spellignore) NOTE: Somehow they work for me but they do not for (#172)
    [x] LaTeX angle braces ('<>') in commands (beamer presentation)

        /\\(\w+)\*?[\s]*([\s]*(\{(?:\{[^\}]*\}|[^\{\}])*\})|[\s]*(\[(?:\[[^\]]*\]|[^\[\]])*\])|[\s]*(\<(?:\<[^>]]*\>|[^\<\>])*\>))*/g

        \begin{frame}<1>[label=myframe]{The list}
            \begin{itemize}[<+->]
                \item Car
                \item Airplane
                \item Watermelon
            \end{itemize}
        \end{frame}

    [x] Refreshing only when necessary

    onDidOpenTextDocument - spell entire document
    onDidSaveTextDocument - spell (or not) entire document

    onDidChangeTextDocument - diff spelling

    onDidChangeVisibleTextEditors - update indicators
    onDidChangeActiveTextEditor - update indicators

    Language Switch - spell visible, invalidata invisible

    [x] Maybe add dictionaries URL (check whether they are UTF-8)
    [X] Additiona punctuatuion characters
    [x] In-Document Commands quoted/unquoted
    [x] Rename token, extoken, charmap etc. to more consistent names with word, source, map etc.
    [x] checkAndMark: context -> token.context
    [-] Screenshots of examples in README should have:
        [-] Comments/strings spelled in different languages (obsolete with multilanguage version)
        [-] Latex example with switching language using LATEX magic commands and/or In-Document commands (also seems obsolete with multilanguage version)
    [ ] Include embedded HTML (typeScriptReact etc...)

        https://regex101.com/r/pE1mT5/16

    [x] Diacritics in LaTeX
    [x] Multiline command in LaTeX

        /\\\w+\*?(\[[\s\S]*?\])*((\{|\()[\s\S]*?(\}|\)))*(\[[\s\S]*?\])*/g

        \setmainfont[
        BoldFont={Segoe UI Semibold},
        ItalicFont={Segoe UI Italic},
        BoldItalicFont={Segoe UI Bold}
        ]{Segoe UI Semibold}

    [ ] Add parsers' parameters to `spellright.parserByClass`
    [ ] Markdown indented code blocks vs. bulleted lists (#105)

        /^\s*(\*|\+|-|\d+\.)\s*/gm
        _indent = 

    [ ] Spell attributes in XML documents
    [ ] Detect language from file name (split to parts, see if anything matches language code) - taken from speller for Visual Studio related to resource files (e.g. something.en.xml)
    [ ] Extra functionality: Go to first occurrence, Go to next/previous occurrence, List of suggestions to replace all occurrences, add all issues to dictionary

    [-] JSON with Comments gets parser automatically - why? (Because they are supported from inside of spellright)
    [-] Add editor/title icon for quick switching ON/OFF for current file

    [x] #125  Spelling documents' syntactic elements e.g. comments and strings in different languages
    [x] #121 not handling some LaTeX commands
    [x] Commands spanning on multiple lines in LaTeX removed from spelling correctly
    [x] Switching language for an unsaved document choses workspace language (?)
    [x] Markdown indented code blocks vs. bulleted lists (#105)

    [x] Priority for status bar item
    [x] Configure parsers for unknown document types.

    [x] Strings in Makefile
    [x] Parameters inside {} in LaTeX
    [x] Configuration <-> Settings agree
    [x] Closing document (z.b. PDF) leaves diagnostics
    [x] Switching language in large document leaves parts checked in previous language
    [x] All vars to consts in spellright.js
    [x] Multi-root workspace
    [x] On setting OFF delete diagnostics
    [x] Color of the OFF symbol should be red for .spellignore ignored files too!
    [x] test.log in .spellignore disabled folder /test/ is WHITE off instead of RED.
    [x] Support multi root workspaces!
    [x] Support % [!TEX directives](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/78101/when-and-why-should-i-use-tex-ts-program-and-tex-encoding), especially spellcheck, e.g.: * !TEX spellcheck = en

    q-a-section:

        [x] What if I want to add a document type (language) that is not spelled?
        [x] Why there is a maximum of 251 spelling errors highlighted?

    commands:

        `
        Command format:

        spellcheck: [command] [parameters]
        spellcheck-[command] [parameters]

        Valid commands:

        language [language|language-region]
        on
        off

        Future commands:

        stop
        start
        ignoreWords [list]
        ignoreRegExps [list]
        `
