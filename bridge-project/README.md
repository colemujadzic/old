## bridge-project

A car bridge simulation in C++ using pThreads

**To compile and run the program:**

First, you should make sure you have a GCC-compatible compiler for C++ (like g++)

In your terminal, enter:

```console 
$ g++ -o main main.cpp
```

After the program compiles, enter:
```console
$ ./main X < input.txt"
```
where ```X``` is some integer value denoting the maximum weight of the bridge.
